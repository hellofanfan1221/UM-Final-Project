Impress your dinner guests with Northwest Fish’s gigantic warm water lobster tails. These tails come from the waters of the central and south pacific, delivering a light and tender taste. These large lobster tails offer numerous recipe opportunities in the kitchen and on the grill. Lobster tail meat is dense muscular meat with a relatively mild flavor that takes spices easily. For example, putting the tail on its ‘back’ and splitting it in half allows the halves to be marinated with a combination as simple as white wine, olive oil and minced garlic and then sautéed in a cast iron skillet or on a flat grill. The raw tail can be deconstructed and the meat removed in one piece and after removing the vein the meat can be cut into medallions to be broiled, grilled, or enrobed and baked. The leftover meat is excellent for cold preparations (salads, sandwiches, lobster rolls) or an Eggs Benedict with lobster instead of Bacon, don’t skimp on the sherry.

seamless power to your PC and make certain you have time to safely shut down
your system during a longer outage.    


Home Networking/VoIP
Keep your smart-home devices connected to your WIFI during power outages and brownouts. 


Personal Electronics
